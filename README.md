# Design and Implementation of a Communication Network for the project MURMEL
This archive contains the work done within the scope of the thesis submitted for the partial fulfillment of the requirement for a Master's Degree in Mechanical Engineering at Technische Universität Berlin.

The main purpose of the project is to establish a communication network for the project MURMEL. Via the developed communication
network, route information, sensor values, and actuator states will be instantly shared between services robots, smart dustbins, and the application control center.



Since the communication
and coordination of MURMEL robots are seen as one of the most critical challenges in the
MURMEL project, this study aims to develop a solution architecture that meets the project’s
communication requirements. During the development phase, the latest developments in IoT
technologies and smart city applications will be examined, and a highly efficient communica-
tion network will be developed in line with the project needs. Via the developed communication
network, route information, sensor values, and actuator states will be instantly shared between
robots, waste bins, and the central management center.

Repository consists of three main components of the communication network
- LoRaWAN implementation for the *Smart Dustbins*
- ROS package for the *Service Robot*
- Murmel Application Server
