# Design and Implementation of a Communication Network for the project MURMEL
This archive contains the work done within the scope of the [thesis](/docs/master_thesis.pdf) submitted for the partial fulfillment of the requirement for a Master's Degree in Mechanical Engineering at Technische Universit√§t Berlin.

The main purpose of the project is to establish a communication network for the project MURMEL based on the defined requirements. Via the developed communication
network, route information, sensor values, and actuator states will be instantly shared between services robots, smart dustbins, and the application control center.
